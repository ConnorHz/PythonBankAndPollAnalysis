# Python Bank and Polling Analysis
Using python scripts, extract and analyze data for fictional financial and polling data.
Bonus challenges included writing scripts to reformat mock employee data and analyze text files.

## PyBank
In this exercise, I created a python script to analyze the financial data (CSV) of a fictional company. The data consisted of the company's month by month profit/loss information.
The script imported the data from the CSV and determined the following
  * Total number of months included in the dataset
  * Net total amount of Profit/Loss
  * Average month to month Profit/Loss change
  * The month with the greatest increase in profits
  * The month with the greatest decrease in profits
 The financial analysis was then printed to the console and written to a text file.
  
## PyPoll
In this exercise, I created a python script to analyze the polling data (CSV) of a fictional election. The data consisted of a voter ID, the county in which the voter voted, and the last name of the candidate that was voted for. The script imported the data from the CSV and determined the following
  * Total number of votes
  * A list of candidates with how many votes as well as the percentage of votes won
  * The winner of the election based on the most votes
 The election results were then printed to the console and written to a text file.
  
 ## PyBoss
In this exercise, I created a python script to analyze the employee records (CSV) of a fictional company. The data consisted of an employee ID, the employee's name, date of birth, social security number, and state of residence. The script imported the data from the CSV and formatted it in the following ways.
 * Split the employees name into columns for their first and last names
 * Reformatted their DOB from YYYY-MM-DD to MM/DD/YYYY
 * Formatted their SSN to only show the last four digits (ex. \*\*\*-\*\*-9165)
 * Replaced their spelled-out state of residence to the state's abbreviation
The formatted data was then exported to a new CSV file

## PyParagraph
In this exercise, I created a python script to analyze the text in a text file. The text file could be anything, but the intention is to analyze readable text (ex. page of a book, article of a magazine, or a movie script). The script imported the text from the file and determined the following
 * Approximate word count
 * Approximate sentence count
 * Approximate letter count (per word)
 * Average sentence length (in words)
