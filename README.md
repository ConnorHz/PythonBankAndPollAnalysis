# Python Bank and Polling Analysis
Using python scripts, extract and analzye data for fictional financial and polling data.
Bonus challenges included writing scripts to reformat mock employee data and analyze text files.

## PyBank
In this exercise, I created a python script to analyze the financial data (csv) of a fictional company. The data consisted of the company's month by month profit/loss information.
The script imported the data from the csv and determined the following
  * Total number of months included in the dataset
  * Net total amount of Profit/Loss
  * Average month to month Profit/Loss change
  * The month with the greatest increase in profits
  * The month with the greatest decrease in profits

In this exercise, I created a python script to analyze the polling data (csv) of a fictional election. The data consisted of a voter ID, the county in which the voter voted, and the last name of the candidate that was voted for. The script imported the data from the csv and determind the following
  * Total number of votes
